# Compile with Visual Studio Code

## Step by Step

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download){target=_blank} (vscode).
2. In vscode, install the [PlatformIO
   Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide){target=_blank}
3. Install GIT and enable GIT in vscode -
   [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads/){target=_blank} -
   [Instructions](https://www.jcchouinard.com/install-git-in-vscode/){target=_blank}
4. Clone the [code repository](https://github.com/helgeerbe/OpenDTU-OnBattery).
   You really have to clone it, do not download and extract a source ZIP file.
   During the build process the GIT hash gets embedded into the firmware. If you
   download and extract the source ZIP file a build error will occur.
5. In vscode, choose **File** --> **Open Folder** and select the previously
   downloaded source code (you have to select the folder which contains the
   `platformio.ini` and `platformio_override.ini` files).
6. Adjust the COM port in the file `platformio_override.ini` for your
   USB-to-serial-converter. It occurs twice:
    * `upload_port`
    * `monitor_port`
7. Mandatory: [Build the WebApp](compile_webapp.md) **before** compiling the firmware.
8. Select the arrow button in the blue bottom status bar (PlatformIO: Upload) to
   compile and upload the firmware. During the compilation, all required
   libraries are downloaded automatically.

## Troubleshooting

In Linux, if the upload fails with error messages "Could not open /dev/ttyUSB0,
the port doesn't exist", you can check via ```ls -la /dev/tty*``` to which
group your port belongs to, and then add your username to this group via ```sudo
adduser <yourusername> dialout``` (if you are using ```arch-linux``` use:
```sudo gpasswd -a <yourusername> uucp```; this method requires a logout/login
of the affected user).

There are two videos showing these steps (possibly not including [building the
WebApp](compile_webapp.md)):
